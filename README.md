Multithreaded Web Server (Java, Apache JMeter, TCP/IP, Multithreading)

1.Developed a high-concurrency web server using Java sockets and multithreading to handle parallel client connections.

2.Engineered a multithreaded client simulator to initiate concurrent requests and validate server responsiveness.

3.Benchmarked server performance under heavy load by generating 1 million+ requests using Apache JMeter.

4.Achieved stable, concurrent processing with minimal resource contention via efficient thread management.
